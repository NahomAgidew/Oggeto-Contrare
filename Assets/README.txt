OgettoContatore.cs tracks the number of objects in your game world. 

Attach it to an empty game object or any other gameobject,
Tag everything you want to count with any type of text for example you can tag your enemy object as "Enemy"
and add Enemy in the Objects list, then you're done. 

You can later retrieve the number from another script as shown in TestOC.cs (with just one line of code). 

Tip
Delete bmb, and blt objects manually to test if it works, the number of bombs and bullets should decrease and
be logged in the console :)
